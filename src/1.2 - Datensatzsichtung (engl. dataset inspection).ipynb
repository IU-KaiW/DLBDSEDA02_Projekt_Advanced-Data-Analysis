I think they are the biggest scam of since the mortgage industry's major meltdown and I hope I move somewhere where Comcast does not exist. The disregard to want to help or do the right thing is honestly astounding. If you have to call, which you do FOR ALL ISSUES - billing, connection/service, adding or removing service, errors, it does not matter you will be transferred minimum of 4 times. Everyone says the same thing and passes the issues to the next person and no one resolves the problem.They offer promotional packages in small timeframes and can never access them again so they then upgrade you without you wishing and change your billing. It has been 5 months and I have been overcharged $40 a month since I started with them. The blatant rudeness that must make you qualified to do this job is the type of quality service that gets you this review. So... Dear Comcast, you suck.

Pro, however this isn't part of the contract, which means that Comcast can increase the price whenever they want within the 2 years. This means I haven't received the advertised rate. Comcast has so far refused to issue corrected contract, or issue in writing that the $30 will remain at that price for 2 years. I just have to trust them.

While I was in the local Walmart on November 4, 2016, there were customer representatives from Xfinity running promotions for and in the Salt Lake City area. Spoke with a representative and was able to get and signed a contract for Pro Blast at $50.00 a month with no contract or early termination fees. I received an email from Xfinity stating the changes that would be made to my account. It stated that not only would it be under contract for 24 months but there would be early termination fees. This is not what I had originally signed up for and it specifically states this on the contract that I signed. Contacted Xfinity customer service and was told since they cannot see the contract over the phone that I would need to go to Xfinity store in person. Went to Xfinity store on November 8, 2016 and was told that it would be under contract and there was no way around it. Because of this I have cancelled the upgrade and went back to my original plan. It's plain and simple. When a contract is signed it should be honored for what is stated on it. Xfinity is dishonest and not trustworthy. Therefore I will be looking and changing my ISP as soon as possible to another company. Xfinity does not deserve a paycheck from me or anyone else that I know.</td>\n",

Finally got someone when my special needs neighbor tripped and fell!Now 3 months into my contract, I have had my internet, phone, and TV go out for HOURS at a time. I would spend 3 hours on with a tech when it will come back up after the technician resets the router manually for the 3rd or 4th time. I have had it, I work from home occasionally and this is a huge inconvenience! The hardware is faulty, I understand that sometimes you get a lemon... but 3 months! 3 months! I have had it. Worst company ever. Crappy equipment and terrible customer service, and worse is the technicians they hire! Not a clue! Comcast should send a technician out here to switch out this equipment before I set a bonfire to it.</td>\n",

Definitely switching to Verizon. I'd rather pay $10 extra then dealing w/ Comcast and non stopping internet problems.  \n",

I have never worked with any industry with as bad of customer service as Comcast. It is not a matter of money because I make well enough above and beyond to afford their services but they are a legitimate ripoff. I think they are the biggest scam of since the mortgage industry's major meltdown and I hope I move somewhere where Comcast does not exist. The disregard to want to help or do the right thing is honestly astounding. If you have to call, which you do FOR ALL ISSUES - billing, connection/service, adding or removing service, errors, it does not matter you will be transferred minimum of 4 times. Everyone says the same thing and passes the issues to the next person and no one resolves the problem.They offer promotional packages in small timeframes and can never access them again so they then upgrade you without you wishing and change your billing. It has been 5 months and I have been overcharged $40 a month since I started with them. The blatant rudeness that must make you qualified to do this job is the type of quality service that gets you this review. So... Dear Comcast, you suck. Sincerely, a customer who cannot wait to never use your service again.  \n",

Nothing but problems. Two no shows on scheduled service appointments, extreme difficulty in adding boxes to the second floor. What is so difficult about adding boxes to an existing account? No thank you, I'm not starting a second account for the second floor of the same house! A separate bundle package? All I wanted was just to add a few boxes. Apparently this is not possible. Well then, I guess it's not possible to remain a customer!  \n",

I signed up for $49.99 150Mbps internet for 2 years, however my contract has $19.99 for 25Mbps internet for 2 years. They say there is an add on in place for $30 which boost it to Blast! Pro, however this isn't part of the contract, which means that Comcast can increase the price whenever they want within the 2 years. This means I haven't received the advertised rate. Comcast has so far refused to issue corrected contract, or issue in writing that the $30 will remain at that price for 2 years. I just have to trust them. So watch out, Comcast is doing the usual illegal practices, I'm guessing to catch people out and hope they don't notice and end up paying more than they should.  \n",

       "6  I Have been a long time customer and only have Xfinity as my ISP for a while now. While I was in the local Walmart on November 4, 2016, there were customer representatives from Xfinity running promotions for and in the Salt Lake City area. Spoke with a representative and was able to get and signed a contract for Pro Blast at $50.00 a month with no contract or early termination fees. I received an email from Xfinity stating the changes that would be made to my account. It stated that not only would it be under contract for 24 months but there would be early termination fees. This is not what I had originally signed up for and it specifically states this on the contract that I signed. Contacted Xfinity customer service and was told since they cannot see the contract over the phone that I would need to go to Xfinity store in person. Went to Xfinity store on November 8, 2016 and was told that it would be under contract and there was no way around it. Because of this I have cancelled the upgrade and went back to my original plan. It's plain and simple. When a contract is signed it should be honored for what is stated on it. Xfinity is dishonest and not trustworthy. Therefore I will be looking and changing my ISP as soon as possible to another company. Xfinity does not deserve a paycheck from me or anyone else that I know.  \n",

Customer service is fairly certain that the problem is from the signal from their system to ours, but protocol demands that they access our home before investigating that option. Since we work, that cannot be done until next Saturday. Customer service tech agreed that this seems illogical since logic would dictate that one would investigate the most probably malfunction first, but insists they must follow protocol. This is extremely frustrating. After 35 years as a customer of Comcast & their predecessors, I am investigating alternatives.  \n",

All are eh... but you know what? Comcast takes the cake. I have never been driven to take time out of my day just to gripe online for all to see. But consumers, stay away! So my first terrible experience with Comcast is that they took 5 phones and 2 months to come out and bury the lines they had to lay in my front yard to get the cable needed into my house. Finally got someone when my special needs neighbor tripped and fell!Now 3 months into my contract, I have had my internet, phone, and TV go out for HOURS at a time. I would spend 3 hours on with a tech when it will come back up after the technician resets the router manually for the 3rd or 4th time. I have had it, I work from home occasionally and this is a huge inconvenience! The hardware is faulty, I understand that sometimes you get a lemon... but 3 months! 3 months! I have had it. Worst company ever. Crappy equipment and terrible customer service, and worse is the technicians they hire! Not a clue! Comcast should send a technician out here to switch out this equipment before I set a bonfire to it.  "
