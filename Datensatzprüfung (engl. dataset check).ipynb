    "\n",
    "This repository contains a Python program that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine whether a given paragraph was generated by AI or written by a human. The program utilizes the `transformers` library and a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to make an educated guess about the origin of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this approach provides a basic starting point for detecting AI-generated content and may not be entirely accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilizes the `transformers` library for text classification tasks.\n",
    "- Employs a pre-trained sentiment analysis model for classification.\n",
    "- Offers a configurable confidence threshold for AI-generated text identification.\n",
    "- Demonstrates a simplified approach to distinguishing between AI and human-generated paragraphs.\n",
    "- Provides insights into the challenges and limitations of AI text detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
